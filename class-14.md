# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Class 14 Reading Notes - (source cred: developer.mozilla.org)  

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to continue to develop our understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Continuing to further our understanding of the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer.
>
> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### CSS Transforms

```
1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

  - With 'transform' elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane.

2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

  - An example of using transform is being able to put 3D elements using CSS on a webpage. Imagine a table or a graph in 3 dimensions without JS.

```

### CSS Transitions & Animations

```
1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

  - With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

  - Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

### 8 simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users

```
1. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

  - Just a couple of lines of code will give you an awesome transition effect that will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions.

2. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

  - CSS3 is amazing. When I was young I often considered a career in computer animation. It was a dream I was never able to live out- or maybe its never too late. As I've said many times in this course- I love design. As a graphic designer I love to take pictures or logos and make them fit a certain asthetic. With CSS transitions and animations I will get to explore another aspect of design that may align with what I want to do as a career moving forward.
