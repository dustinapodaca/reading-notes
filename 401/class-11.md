### Event Driven Programming

```
1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
  - The 'events' module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming in Node.js.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
  - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) can be useful in tandem with Event Driven Programming as OOP allows us to model real-world objects and their behaviors in our code. This can make it easier to understand and reason about the logic of our event-driven systems, as the objects and their interactions can be more easily visualized and understood.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
  - On the backend, Event Driven Programming can be useful for building scalable and efficient systems. For example, if we have a server that needs to handle a large number of requests concurrently, we can use Event Driven Programming to ensure that our server is able to handle those requests efficiently by setting up event listeners that are triggered when a request is received. This allows our server to process requests asynchronously, rather than blocking and waiting for a response before moving on to the next request. This can help improve the performance and scalability of our backend systems.
