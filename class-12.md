# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Class 12 Reading Notes - (source cred: developer.mozilla.org)  

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to continue to develop our understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Continuing to further our understanding of the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer.
>
> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### JavaScript Canvas

```
1. What does the <canvas> allow a developer to acheive?

  - The HTML5 canvas element is used to achieve the drawing of 2D graphics.

2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?

  -  The <canvas> element requires the closing tag </canvas>. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesn’t support the <canvas> element.

3. Explain what the getContext() method does.

  - One can use the getContext('2d') to get the 2D drawing context for drawing 2D graphics on canvas. the getContext() method that returns a render context object. The getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context. 
  - For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface. The 2D rendering context allows you to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.

### Chart.js Documentation

```
1. What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?

  - Chart.js is a free, open-source JavaScript library for data visualization, which supports eight chart types: bar, line, area, pie, bubble, radar, polar, and scatter. It is brought into our project using a <canvas> element to then display data.

2. List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.

  - Chart types: bar, line, area, pie, bubble, radar, polar, and scatter.

### Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

```
1. What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?

  - Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly.

2. How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?

  - It provides a visual element that previous may look mundane and unappealing.
