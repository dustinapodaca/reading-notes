# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Class 03 Reading Notes - (source cred: developer.mozilla.org)  

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to continue to develop our understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Continuing to further our understanding of the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer.
>
> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### Learn HTML
```
1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

    -  A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

    - The href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, contains the web address.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

    - You can ensure you use clear link wording, leave clear signposts, and use the download attribute when linking to a download.

### CSS Layout
```
1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

    - Normal flow is the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

    - A block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. 
    - The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content.
    - You can't set width or height on inline elements.

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

    - 'Static' positioning

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

    - An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

    - Let's now look at fixed positioning. This works in exactly the same way as absolute positioning, with one key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

### Learn JS
#### Functions
- An essential concept in coding is **functions**, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times.

```
1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

    - The function declaration (function statement) defines a function with the specified parameters. The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined. The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

    - Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them — these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly. Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes.

#### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
```
1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

    - Engaged collaboration
    - Learning from fellow students
        - I for one know that I am not the most gifted or 'smartest' in the class. But I am a visual learner and do well working with others. If I can engage and see how others apply their knowledge to the craft- I can usually not be too far behind. I love engaging with others and am a pretty extroverted person and so being able to have that engaged collaboration where I can learn from fellow students besides just TA's and our instructor is the best benefit of remo and our collaborative process.
