# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Class 08 Reading Notes - (source cred: developer.mozilla.org)  

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to continue to develop our understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Continuing to further our understanding of the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer.
>
> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### Learn CSS - Flexbox
```
1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

  - The Flexible Box Layout Model (flexbox) is a layout model designed for one-dimensional content. It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

  - The main axis is the one set by your [flex-direction] property. If that is [row] your main axis is along the row, if it is [column] your main axis is along the column. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if [flex-direction] is [row] the cross axis runs along the column.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

  -  You should be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, as it can negatively impact accessibility. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

### CSS Layout - Flexbox

```
1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

  - For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating. The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:
    - Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
    - Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
    - Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

  - My long term goals with coding defintiely align moreso on the design side of things. I have a graphic design background and so being able to explore CSS and how websites look and function is important to me. The analytical and logical side of JS is a bit more challenging for me but anytime we dive into design I am typically able to pick things up much faster and so I always look forward to see us implement that in class and in the future as a possible career.
