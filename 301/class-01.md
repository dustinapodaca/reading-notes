# Code 301 Reading Notes

## Class 01 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraies such as React.js to further implement more dymanic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## Component-Based Architecture

```
1. What is a “component”?

  - A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
  - A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

2. What are the characteristics of a component?

  - Reusability, Replaceable, Not context specific, Extensible, Encapsulated, Independent. 

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

  - Ease of deployment, Reduced Cost, Ease of development, Reusable, Modification of technical complexity, Reliability, System maintenance and evolution, Independent.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

```
1. What is “props” short for?

  - “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

2. How are props used in React?

  - Firstly, define an attribute and its value(datat then pass it to child component(s) by using Props- finally, render the Props Data.

3. What is the flow of props?

  - Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child) Props are being passed to components like function arguments
