# Code 301 Reading Notes

## Class 11 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraries such as React.js to further implement more dynamic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
| --- | ----- |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS) | non-relational or distributed database |
| table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | queries are focused on collection of documents |

## SQL Vs. NoSQL

```
1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

  - complex queries, relational data, and data that is highly structured.

2. Give a real world example.

  - MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Postgres and MS Access.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

  - NoSQL databases are highly preferred for hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

4. Give a real world example.

  - MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

  - NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

  - NoSQL databases are highly preferred for scalability.

```

## SQL Vs. NoSQL PT.2

```
1. What does SQL stand for?

  - Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?

  - A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

  - Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.

4. What is a ‘schema’?

  - A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects.

5. What is a NoSQL database?

  - NoSQL databases are a type of non-relational database used to store and retrieve data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

6. How does it work?

  - NoSQL works by storing data in documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores.

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

  - A MongoDB database is a container for collections. A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

  - MongoDB is more flexible than SQL because it is a document database and it is not bound by the table structure.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

  - The disadvantage of NoSQL databases is that they are not as mature as SQL databases and they are not as widely used.
