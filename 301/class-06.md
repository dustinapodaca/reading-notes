# Code 301 Reading Notes

## Class 06 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraies such as React.js to further implement more dymanic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## An Introduction to Node.js

```
1. What is node.js?

 - Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

  - V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

  - Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

4. What is npm?

  - npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

  - v18.9.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

  - v8.19.1

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

  - npm install -g jshint

8. What is node used for?

  - Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It’s used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

```
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

  - Greater efficiency
  - Engaged collaboration
  - Learning from fellow students
  - Social skills
  - Job interview readiness
  - Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

  - Greater efficiency and engaged collaboration and learning from fellow students.

3. How does pair programming work?

  - Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
