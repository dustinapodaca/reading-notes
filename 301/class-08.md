# Code 301 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraries such as React.js to further implement more dynamic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## API Design Best Practices

```
1. What does REST stand for?

  - Representational State Transfer.

2. REST APIs are designed around ____.

  - Resources.

3. What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.

  - A URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be: https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

4. What are the most common HTTP verbs?

  - The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5. What should the URIs be based on?

  - URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

6. Give an example of a good URI.

  - https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

  - API that expose a large number of small resources. It is a bad thing.

8. What status code does a successful GET request return?

  - A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK).

9. What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

  - If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

10. What status code does a successful POST request return?

  - If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created).

11. What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

  - If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content).
