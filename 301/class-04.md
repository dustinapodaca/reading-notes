# Code 301 Reading Notes

## Class 04 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraies such as React.js to further implement more dymanic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## React Docs - Forms

```
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

  - A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

  - We should update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them because it is a controlled component.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

  - We target what the user is entering by using the event.target.value property.

```

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

```
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

  - We would use a ternary operator to simplify an if/else statement.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

      if(x===y){
        console.log(true);
      } else {
        console.log(false);
      }

    - x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
