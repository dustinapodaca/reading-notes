# Code 301 Reading Notes

## Class 07 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraries such as React.js to further implement more dynamic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## How I explained REST to my brother

```
1. Who is Roy Fielding?

  - Roy Fielding is one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  
  - Because they weren't designed to be used like that. They were designed to be used by a small group of people, on a small group of machines.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

  - HTTP is the protocol that Fielding and his friends created to enable computers to talk to each other.
4. What does a GET do?

  - GET is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

5. What does a POST do?

  - POST is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

6. What does PUT do?

  - PUT is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource.

7. What does PATCH do?

  - PATCH is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
