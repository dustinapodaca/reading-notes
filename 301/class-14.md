## Class 14 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraries such as React.js to further implement more dynamic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

```
1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

  - The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. 

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

  - Because most males had been playing on computers growing up, they had prior knowledge and experience with computers. This gave them a head start in the field of computer science.

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies
- Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

```
1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

  - Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

  - Diverse companies perform better because they’re better at solving problems. They get more done. They’re more creative. They’re more innovative. They’re more profitable.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

  - A diverse company can serve a diverse user base because they have a better understanding of the needs of their users. They can also serve a diverse user base because they have a better understanding of the needs of their users.
