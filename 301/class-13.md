# Code 301 Reading Notes

## Class 13 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraries such as React.js to further implement more dynamic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## CRUD Basics

```
1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

  - You would use the PUT method.

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

  - The GET, PUT, and DELETE methods require an ID parameter.

```

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

```
1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

  - REST is a set of guidelines for how to structure your API. CRUD is a set of guidelines for how to structure your database.

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

  - 1. Define the routes.
  - 2. Define the methods.
  - 3. Define the parameters.
  - 4. Define the responses.
  - 5. Define the errors.

```
