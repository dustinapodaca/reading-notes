# Code 301 Reading Notes

## Class 09 Reading Notes

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to have a deeper understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Understanding the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer. One can build upon those basics by learning other frameworks and libraries such as React.js to further implement more dynamic user interfaces for an overall better experience.

> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

## Functional Programming Concepts

```
1. What is functional programming?

  - Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

  - A pure function is a function that has the following properties:
  - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
  - It does not cause any observable side effects.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

  - The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

4. What is immutability?

  - Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

5. What is Referential transparency?

  - If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

```
1. What is a module?

  - A module is a piece of code that is used in another piece of code. It is a way to break down a large program into smaller parts.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?

  - The require() function is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. It is used to load modules dynamically at runtime.

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

  - We use the require() function to bring another module into the file we are working in.

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

  - We have to export the module.
