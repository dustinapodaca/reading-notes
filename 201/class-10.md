# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Class 10 Reading Notes - (source cred: developer.mozilla.org)  

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to continue to develop our understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Continuing to further our understanding of the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer.
>
> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

```
1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

  - Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

  - Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

  - I have definitely come across syntax errors on many occasions and typically where the eslint.json was not able to pick it up, the JS console would and I was be able to resolve. 

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

  - Today in class we were able to find a JS bug that I had in my cookie-stand project. It really showed how fun it can be at times to try and get down into the details to find the one thing that is missing. It showed me that my long term goal of being a software engineer is something that I will not grow tired of and will be rewarding.

### The JavaScript Debugger.

```
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

  - The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, that is- places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly. Put simply- it allows you to go through your code slowly and see where it could break or where it may go astray.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

  -  A breakpoint is a point in the program  where the code will stop executing.

3. What is the call stack?

  - The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
