# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Class 13 Reading Notes - (source cred: developer.mozilla.org)  

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to continue to develop our understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Continuing to further our understanding of the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer.
>
> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

```
1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

  - Storing information locally on a user’s computer is a powerful strategy for a developer who is creating something for the Web. As a developer, you need to store the state of your interface somewhere. Normally, this is done server-side, and you would check the user name to know which state to revert to. But what if you don’t want to force people to sign up?
  - This is where local storage comes in. You would keep a key on the user’s computer and read it out when the user returns.

2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

  - Local storage should never be used for sensitive information such as passwords or personal information.

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

  - Local storage can only store 'string' data. You can convert data by using JSON.stringify before storing.
