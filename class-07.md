# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Class 07 Reading Notes - (source cred: developer.mozilla.org)  

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to continue to develop our understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Continuing to further our understanding of the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer.
>
> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### Domain Modeling

```
1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

  - A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

### HTML Table Basics

```
1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

  - Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, tables produce tag soup, and tables are not automatically responsive.

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

  - <td> - for table data: Each <td> element creates a single cell and together they make up the first row. Every cell we add makes the row grow longer.
  - <tr> - for table row: adds additional rows to your table.
  - <th> - for table header: allows column and row headings to stand out.

### Introducing Constructors

```
1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

  -  A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:
      * create a new object
      * bind 'this' to the new object, so you can refer to 'this' in your constructor code
      * run the code in the constructor
      * return the new object.

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

  - 'this' in object literal refers to everything within the object that you are referring too where in a constructor 'this' to bind to the new object so you can refer to it in your constructor code.

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

```
1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
