# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Class 03 Reading Notes - (source cred: developer.mozilla.org)  

> Why this topic matters? - It is important to continue to develop our understanding of how the internet works. HTML, CSS, and JS are the code files from which websites are primarily built. Continuing to further our understanding of the roles that each play is essential to becoming a programmer or web developer.
>
> - **HTML** - creates the structure i.e. the backbone.
>   - HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
> - **CSS** - stylizes the website or makes it look good.
>  
>   - CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
> - **JavaScript** - increases interactivity; handles more complex functions and features and enhances site functionality.
>  
>   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### HTML Media

```
1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

  - A real world use case is when the user is visually impaired, and is using a screen reader to read the web out to them. In fact, having alt text available to describe images is useful to most users. You may also want to provide text for search engines to utilize; for example, search engines can match alt text with search queries.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

  - You can add an alt attribute with a description as well as add a title attribute to further add supporting information.

3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

  -  One can use the HTML <figure> and <figcaption> elements. These are created to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption.

4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

  - An SVG image is a vector graphic that does not pixelate when resized. It is commonly used in logos.
  - A GIF image is a good image to use for short animations or very simple images. Usually it is a small fize size.

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

  - I would use a PNG as it is a more precise image and typically is a better quality than a jpg.

### Learn CSS

```
1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

  -  The foreground colors are those that are directly on top of or within the element whereas the background colors would be any of those behind the foreground.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

  - You could add color to the background, within boxes, you can create borders and apply color stylistically there as well. Once could also add canvas elements and graphics to decorate the page.

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

  - When choosing fonts one should consider the font family and what the intention of the font is for. Different font families are typically used in certain situations and so you would want to consider the proper font family for your usecase. One also should consider the size and weight of the fonts used.

4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

  - font-size increases the size of the font.
  - font-weight sets how bold the text of the font is.
  - font-style is used to turn italic text on and off within the font.

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

  - One could apply some word- and letter-spacing to the <h1> element 
  - h1 {
    letter-spacing: 4px;
    word-spacing: 4px;
    }
